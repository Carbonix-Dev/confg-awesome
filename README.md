# CarbonixOS AwesomeWM Config
**Note:**
There's a few visual bugs I want to fix, and the code needs a bit of a rewrite, especially
to work well in a full-scale desktop environment setup (i.e. proper settings program, etc.).
Mileage may vary, install at your own risk, as it will likely not work. I use this on my own
system, but I also know that there are various packages I needed to install to make everything
work.


## What is this?
This is the configuration for AwesomeWM. AwesomeWM is a window manager running in X11, and is 
what powers the desktop environment in the main computer mode. For the mobile mode configuration,
see [config-hyprland](https://github.com/Carbonix-Dev/config-hyprland).
