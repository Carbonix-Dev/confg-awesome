# CarbonixOS AwesomeWM Config
There's a few visual bugs I want to fix, and the code needs a bit of a rewrite, especially
to work well in a full-scale desktop environment setup (i.e. proper settings program, etc.).
Mileage may vary, install at your own risk, as it will likely not work. I use this on my own
system, but I also know that there are various packages I needed to install to make everything
work.
